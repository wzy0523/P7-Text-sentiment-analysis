# P7-Text-sentiment-analysis

The Bert, Albert, CNN and LSTM files can be run directly to output all the results of using the four algorithms on all datasets.

In the CNN file: 
The implementation of cnn model structure comes from the Modification of https://github.com/graykode/nlp-tutorial and https://wmathor.com/index.php/archives/1445/.
The encapsulation of functions, cross validation, model training, and the use of our dataset come from my code writing.

In Bert and Albert: 
The code is almost entirely written by us.

In LSTM:
The implementation of model structure comes from the Modification of https://github.com/mihirahlawat/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/CNN%2BLSTM_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb and https://github.com/sanjay-raghu/sentiment-analysis-using-LSTM-keras. The encapsulation of functions, cross validation, model training,parameter selecting and the use of our dataset come from my code writing.
